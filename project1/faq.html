                <h3>Are your Games Single-Player or Mutliplayer?</h3>
                <p>At the moment, we are only focusing on creating single-player campaign titles.</p>
                <p>However, as we are currently expanding our team, multiplayer titles will be in the works. Additionally, we may also add co-op to our existing titles, further enhancing the immersive gameplay by having fellow companions to tackle quests with.</p>

                <h3>What Platforms are your Games Available on?</h3>
                <p>You can download our games either through our official website, or from Steam. Our games are only available on PC and we dont have any plans on expanding to other platforms at this current time.</p>

                <h3>Do you frequently Update your Games?</h3>
                <p>At DEHA Games, our top priority is delivering outstanding RPG titles with flawless gameplay. Which is why, at DEHA Games, we are constantly testing unreleased and existing titles to ensure that our beloved community (you guys) don't have the full potential of our games taken away.</p>
                <p>We have developed a fortnightly routine of testing and updating all our games. Whether it's fixing bugs or glitches, or adding exciting new features that we think you will love. Rest assured that you will always be playing the best version of our games.</p>
                <p>If you do encounter any sort of bug in the game or have ideas that you think might enhance our games, please shoot us a message via our email-its at the bottom of this page!</p>

                <h3>What Engine/tools do you use to build your Games?</h3>
                <p>Naturally, as we are purely an RPG game company, all our titles are crafted with RPG Maker.</p>
                <p>More recently, we have been testing with Godot and Unity for a secret project we can't tell you yet. Be sure to tune in for an announcement of the big reveal in the future!</p>

                <h3>Do your Games support Mods?</h3>
                <p>Yes and No. Our games do not support custom, community-made mods however, we have made our own downloadable mods to spice up your gameplay. They will be made available soon and you can download them straight from our website.</p>
                <p>This is just the beginning of our phase to make our games more interactive with the community-make sure to keep an eye out for when we give the green light for community-made mods!</p>
